    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>What is UNICEF?</h3>
<p>UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) is a United Nations agency responsible for providing humanitarian and developmental aid to children around the world. We work in over 190 countries and territories to protect the rights and improve the lives of every child, everywhere.</p>

<h3>What does UNICEF do?</h3>
<p>UNICEF focuses on child protection, education, health, nutrition, water and sanitation, and emergency relief. We advocate for children's rights and support programs that provide long-term support and immediate aid.</p>

<h3>How can I donate to UNICEF?</h3>
<p>You can donate online through our secure website, by phone, mail, or through monthly giving programs.</p>
