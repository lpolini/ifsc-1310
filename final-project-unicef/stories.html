          <h3>Emma's Impact as a Volunteer</h3>

          <p>
            Emma spent three weeks teaching English and math in rural communities, forming deep connections with the locals. Her time there was filled with moments of learning and personal growth, as she saw firsthand the resilience and determination of the children and families. ‘They taught me as much as I taught them,’ she says, reflecting on the mutual growth the experience brought. The lessons she learned from her students extended beyond academics, helping her to appreciate the importance of community, patience, and understanding. It was a life-changing experience that left an indelible mark on her heart.
